        <p>Once upon a time there was a girl named <span class="spark">Sarah</span> who lived an ordinary life doing ordinary things. But then one day she felt a tiny <span class="spark">spark</span> of inspiration.</p>

<p class="border">She decided to learn how to design, build, and style websites with <span class="spark">HTML & CSS</span>. Then she studied <span class="spark">Javascript</span> to make them interactive and <span class="spark">Ruby</span> to understand back end design. This passion for web development started her on a quest for <span class="spark">fun</span> and <span class="spark"></span> work. She was done with ordinary. It was time to share her knowledge. It was time to be <span class="spark">extraordinary</span>!</p>

<p><span class="spark">Sarah</span> designed and built her first website 14 years ago. Shortly after, she put aside her work to take on the challenge of homeschooling her four charming and brilliant children. Recently, she has rekindled her <span class="spark">love of learning</span> and is taking on projects that <span class="spark">inspire</span> and <span class="spark">excite</span> her.</p>
